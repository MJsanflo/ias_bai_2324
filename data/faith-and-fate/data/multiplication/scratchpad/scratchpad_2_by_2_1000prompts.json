The partial product for this step is A=30 which is the concatenation of the digits we found in each step.\n\nNow, let's multiply 10 by the digit in the tens place of 73, which is 7.\n\n4. Multiply 7 by the digit in the ones place of 10, which is 0. This gives 0 x 7 = 0. Write down the result 0.\n5. Multiply 7 by the digit in the tens place of 10, which is 1. This gives 1 x 7 = 7. Write down the result 7.\n6. The partial product for this step is B=70 which is the concatenation of the digits we found in each step.\n\nNow, let's sum the 2 partial products A and B, and take into account the position of each digit: A=30 (from multiplication by 3) and B=70 (from multiplication by 7 but shifted one place to the left, so it becomes 700). The final answer is 30 x 1 + 70 x 10 = 30 + 700 = 730."
