    "prompt": "Let's perform the multiplication step by step:\n\nLet's multiply 99 by the digit in the ones place of 4, which is 4.\n\n1. Multiply 4 by the digit in the ones place of 99, which is 9. This gives 9 x 4 = 36. Write down the result 6 and carry over the 3 to the next step.\n2. Multiply 4 by the digit in the tens place of 99, which is 9. Add the carryover from the previous step to account for this. This gives (9 x 4) + 3 = 39. Write down the result 39.\n3. The partial product for this step is A=396 which is the concatenation of the digits we found in each step.\n\nNow, let's sum the 1 partial product A, and take into account the position of each digit: A=396 (from multiplication by 4). The final answer is 396 x 1 = 396 = 396."
