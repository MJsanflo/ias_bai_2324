The partial product for this step is B=318052 which is the concatenation of the digits we found in each step.\n\nNow, let's sum the 2 partial products A and B, and take into account the position of each digit: A=238539 (from multiplication by 3) and B=318052 (from multiplication by 4 but shifted one place to the left, so it becomes 3180520). The final answer is 238539 x 1 + 318052 x 10 = 238539 + 3180520 = 3419059."

    "prompt": "Let's perform the multiplication step by step:\n\nLet's multiply 17515 by the digit in the ones place of 32, which is 2.\n\n1. Multiply 2 by the digit in the ones place of 17515, which is 5. This gives 5 x 2 = 10. Write down the result 0 and carry over the 1 to the next step.\n2. Multiply 2 by the digit in the tens place of 17515, which is 1. Add the carryover from the previous step to account for this. This gives (1 x 2) + 1 = 3. Write down the result 3.\n3. Multiply 2 by the digit in the hundreds place of 17515, which is 5. This gives 5 x 2 = 10. Write down the result 0 and carry over the 1 to the next step.\n4. Multiply 2 by the digit in the thousands place of 17515, which is 7. Add the carryover from the previous step to account for this. This gives (7 x 2) + 1 = 15. Write down the result 5 and carry over the 1 to the next step.\n5. Multiply 2 by the digit in the ten-thousands place of 17515, which is 1. Add the carryover from the previous step to account for this. This gives (1 x 2) + 1 = 3. Write down the result 3.\n6. The partial product for this step is A=35030 which is the concatenation of the digits we found in each step.\n\nNow, let's multiply 17515 by the digit in the tens place of 32, which is 3.\n\n7. Multiply 3 by the digit in the ones place of 17515, which is 5. This gives 5 x 3 = 15. Write down the result 5 and carry over the 1 to the next step.\n8. Multiply 3 by the digit in the tens place of 17515, which is 1. Add the carryover from the previous step to account for this. This gives (1 x 3) + 1 = 4. Write down the result 4.\n9. Multiply 3 by the digit in the hundreds place of 17515, which is 5. This gives 5 x 3 = 15. Write down the result 5 and carry over the 1 to the next step.\n10. Multiply 3 by the digit in the thousands place of 17515, which is 7. Add the carryover from the previous step to account for this. This gives (7 x 3) + 1 = 22. Write down the result 2 and carry over the 2 to the next step.\n11. Multiply 3 by the digit in the ten-thousands place of 17515, which is 1. Add the carryover from the previous step to account for this. This gives (1 x 3) + 2 = 5. Write down the result 5.\n12. The partial product for this step is B=52545 which is the concatenation of the digits we found in each step.\n\nNow, let's sum the 2 partial products A and B, and take into account the position of each digit: A=35030 (from multiplication by 2) and B=52545 (from multiplication by 3 but shifted one place to the left, so it becomes 525450). The final answer is 35030 x 1 + 52545 x 10 = 35030 + 525450 = 560480."
