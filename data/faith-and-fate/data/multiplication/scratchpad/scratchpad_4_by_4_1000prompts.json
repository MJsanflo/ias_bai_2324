    "question": "What is 8731 times 2646?",
    "prompt": "Let's perform the multiplication step by step:\n\nLet's multiply 8731 by the digit in the ones place of 2646, which is 6.\n\n1. Multiply 6 by the digit in the ones place of 8731, which is 1. This gives 1 x 6 = 6. Write down the result 6.\n2. Multiply 6 by the digit in the tens place of 8731, which is 3. This gives 3 x 6 = 18. Write down the result 8 and carry over the 1 to the next step.\n3. Multiply 6 by the digit in the hundreds place of 8731, which is 7. Add the carryover from the previous step to account for this. This gives (7 x 6) + 1 = 43. Write down the result 3 and carry over the 4 to the next step.\n4. Multiply 6 by the digit in the thousands place of 8731, which is 8. Add the carryover from the previous step to account for this. This gives (8 x 6) + 4 = 52. Write down the result 52.\n5. The partial product for this step is A=52386 which is the concatenation of the digits we found in each step.\n\nNow, let's multiply 8731 by the digit in the tens place of 2646, which is 4.\n\n6. Multiply 4 by the digit in the ones place of 8731, which is 1. This gives 1 x 4 = 4. Write down the result 4.\n7. Multiply 4 by the digit in the tens place of 8731, which is 3. This gives 3 x 4 = 12. Write down the result 2 and carry over the 1 to the next step.\n8. Multiply 4 by the digit in the hundreds place of 8731, which is 7. Add the carryover from the previous step to account for this. This gives (7 x 4) + 1 = 29. Write down the result 9 and carry over the 2 to the next step.\n9. Multiply 4 by the digit in the thousands place of 8731, which is 8. Add the carryover from the previous step to account for this. This gives (8 x 4) + 2 = 34. Write down the result 34.\n10. The partial product for this step is B=34924 which is the concatenation of the digits we found in each step.\n\nNow, let's multiply 8731 by the digit in the hundreds place of 2646, which is 6.\n\n11. Multiply 6 by the digit in the ones place of 8731, which is 1. This gives 1 x 6 = 6. Write down the result 6.\n12. Multiply 6 by the digit in the tens place of 8731, which is 3. This gives 3 x 6 = 18. Write down the result 8 and carry over the 1 to the next step.\n13. Multiply 6 by the digit in the hundreds place of 8731, which is 7. Add the carryover from the previous step to account for this. This gives (7 x 6) + 1 = 43. Write down the result 3 and carry over the 4 to the next step.\n14. Multiply 6 by the digit in the thousands place of 8731, which is 8. Add the carryover from the previous step to account for this. This gives (8 x 6) + 4 = 52. Write down the result 52.\n15. The partial product for this step is C=52386 which is the concatenation of the digits we found in each step.\n\nNow, let's multiply 8731 by the digit in the thousands place of 2646, which is 2.\n\n16. Multiply 2 by the digit in the ones place of 8731, which is 1. This gives 1 x 2 = 2. Write down the result 2.\n17. Multiply 2 by the digit in the tens place of 8731, which is 3. This gives 3 x 2 = 6. Write down the result 6.\n18. Multiply 2 by the digit in the hundreds place of 8731, which is 7. This gives 7 x 2 = 14. Write down the result 4 and carry over the 1 to the next step.\n19. Multiply 2 by the digit in the thousands place of 8731, which is 8. Add the carryover from the previous step to account for this. This gives (8 x 2) + 1 = 17. Write down the result 17.\n20. The partial product for this step is D=17462 which is the concatenation of the digits we found in each step.\n\nNow, let's sum the 4 partial products A, B, C and D, and take into account the position of each digit: A=52386 (from multiplication by 6), B=34924 (from multiplication by 4 but shifted one place to the left, so it becomes 349240), C=52386 (from multiplication by 6 but shifted two places to the left, so it becomes 5238600) and D=17462 (from multiplication by 2 but shifted three places to the left, so it becomes 17462000). The final answer is 52386 x 1 + 34924 x 10 + 52386 x 100 + 17462 x 1000 = 52386 + 349240 + 5238600 + 17462000 = 23102226."
