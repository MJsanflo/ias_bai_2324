Multiply 2 by the digit in the ones place of 4843, which is 3. This gives 3 x 2 = 6. Write down the result 6.\n12. Multiply 2 by the digit in the tens place of 4843, which is 4. This gives 4 x 2 = 8. Write down the result 8.\n13. Multiply 2 by the digit in the hundreds place of 4843, which is 8. This gives 8 x 2 = 16. Write down the result 6 and carry over the 1 to the next step.\n14. Multiply 2 by the digit in the thousands place of 4843, which is 4. Add the carryover from the previous step to account for this. This gives (4 x 2) + 1 = 9. Write down the result 9.\n15. The partial product for this step is C=9686 which is the concatenation of the digits we found in each step.\n\nNow, let's sum the 3 partial products A, B and C, and take into account the position of each digit: A=14529 (from multiplication by 3), B=38744 (from multiplication by 8 but shifted one place to the left, so it becomes 387440) and C=9686 (from multiplication by 2 but shifted two places to the left, so it becomes 968600). The final answer is 14529 x 1 + 38744 x 10 + 9686 x 100 = 14529 + 387440 + 968600 = 1370569."
