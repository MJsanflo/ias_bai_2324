The partial product for this step is B=25665 which is the concatenation of the digits we found in each step.\n\nNow, let's sum the 2 partial products A and B, and take into account the position of each digit: A=15399 (from multiplication by 3) and B=25665 (from multiplication by 5 but shifted one place to the left, so it becomes 256650). The final answer is 15399 x 1 + 25665 x 10 = 15399 + 256650 = 272049."
