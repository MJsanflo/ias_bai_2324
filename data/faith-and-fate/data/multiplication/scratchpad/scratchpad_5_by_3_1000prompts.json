The partial product for this step is A=402396 which is the concatenation of the digits we found in each step.\n\nNow, let's multiply 67066 by the digit in the tens place of 146, which is 4.\n\n7. Multiply 4 by the digit in the ones place of 67066, which is 6. This gives 6 x 4 = 24. Write down the result 4 and carry over the 2 to the next step.\n8. Multiply 4 by the digit in the tens place of 67066, which is 6. Add the carryover from the previous step to account for this. This gives (6 x 4) + 2 = 26. Write down the result 6 and carry over the 2 to the next step.\n9. Multiply 4 by the digit in the hundreds place of 67066, which is 0. Add the carryover from the previous step to account for this. This gives (0 x 4) + 2 = 2. Write down the result 2.\n10. Multiply 4 by the digit in the thousands place of 67066, which is 7. This gives 7 x 4 = 28. Write down the result 8 and carry over the 2 to the next step.\n11. Multiply 4 by the digit in the ten-thousands place of 67066, which is 6. Add the carryover from the previous step to account for this. This gives (6 x 4) + 2 = 26. Write down the result 26.\n12. The partial product for this step is B=268264 which is the concatenation of the digits we found in each step.\n\nNow, let's multiply 67066 by the digit in the hundreds place of 146, which is 1.\n\n13. Multiply 1 by the digit in the ones place of 67066, which is 6. This gives 6 x 1 = 6. Write down the result 6.\n14. Multiply 1 by the digit in the tens place of 67066, which is 6. This gives 6 x 1 = 6. Write down the result 6.\n15. Multiply 1 by the digit in the hundreds place of 67066, which is 0. This gives 0 x 1 = 0. Write down the result 0.\n16. Multiply 1 by the digit in the thousands place of 67066, which is 7. This gives 7 x 1 = 7. Write down the result 7.\n17. Multiply 1 by the digit in the ten-thousands place of 67066, which is 6. This gives 6 x 1 = 6. Write down the result 6.\n18. The partial product for this step is C=67066 which is the concatenation of the digits we found in each step.\n\nNow, let's sum the 3 partial products A, B and C, and take into account the position of each digit: A=402396 (from multiplication by 6), B=268264 (from multiplication by 4 but shifted one place to the left, so it becomes 2682640) and C=67066 (from multiplication by 1 but shifted two places to the left, so it becomes 6706600). The final answer is 402396 x 1 + 268264 x 10 + 67066 x 100 = 402396 + 2682640 + 6706600 = 9791636."
